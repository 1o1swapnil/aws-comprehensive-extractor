AWS Comprehensive Resource Extractor
A robust Python tool to extract detailed information from 25+ AWS services and export everything to a professionally formatted Excel workbook.
Supports manual AWS profile selection, multi-region support, and is ideal for security reviews, audits, and cloud posture assessments.

üö¶ Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
Make sure you have Python 3.8 or newer installed.
Check your version:
bash
Copy Code
python --version
Virtual Environment (Recommended)
Create and activate a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated:
bash
Copy Code
python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
AWS CLI Configured
You must have the AWS CLI installed and at least one profile configured:
bash
Copy Code
aws configure --profile my-aws-profile
The script uses your AWS CLI credentials and profiles for authentication.
üì¶ Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy Code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-comprehensive-extractor.git
cd aws-comprehensive-extractor
Install dependencies:

# With a specific AWS profile and region
python aws_comprehensive_extractor.py --profile my-aws-profile --region us-west-2
